<p>w2do 2.2.0 has been released! Among several usability improvements, few
bug fixes and general revision of the code itself, the most significant
change is a notable rewrite of associated HTML exporter with introduction
of new default design. See the complete list of changes below.</p>

<h3><a name="improvements"></a>Usability Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wrong command-line option no longer terminates any of the utilities.
    I believe an appropriate warning message is sufficient enough and
    definitely not so annoying.</li>
  <li>Wrong group name is now properly reported, so that user knows, what
    he did wrong.</li>
  <li>Added <code>--shallow</code> option to w2text in case a single list
    with no group names is required.</li>
  <li>Made w2html create separate files for HTML and CSS. The style sheet
    can still be embedded to the page itself using <code>--inline</code>
    option.</li>
  <li>Added <code>--bare</code> option to w2html to make it easier to
    include exported data to another page.</li>
  <li>w2html no longer supports two different themes and a new one was
    designed to take their place. Customisation is newly possible by
    replacing the style sheet.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="bugfixes"></a>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>None of the utilities accept wrong group name any longer: it was
    possible to specify a group with colon in it, which used to have some
    nasty consequences like corrupted save file and/or even unexpected
    crash.</li>
  <li>Added <code>--encoding</code> option to w2html to prevent possible
    browser confusion; when omitted, UTF-8 is used by default as a
    reasonable choice.</li>
  <li>Made w2html properly escape reserved characters to avoid smuggling
    HTML entities inside the tasks.</li>
  <li>Fixed w2html output, so that empty task list no longer results in
    empty file.</li>
</ul>
